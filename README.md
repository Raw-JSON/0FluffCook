# 0FluffCook 🍳 (BETA)

**No Ads. No Life Stories. Just Food.**

A single-file, bloat-free recipe extractor powered by Google Gemini. It takes messy URLs or text and converts them into clean, savable recipe cards.

### ⚠️ Current Status: BETA
**This project is under active development.**
* **The Goal:** Scrape recipes directly from websites to prevent AI hallucinations.
* **The Reality:** Many websites block client-side scrapers (CORS). We use proxies (`corsproxy.io` and `allorigins.win`), but heavily secured sites might still fail to load.
* **Fallback:** If the site blocks the scraper, you can paste the recipe text manually, and the AI will clean it perfectly.

## 🤖 Transparency Note
**I did not write this code.** This entire application was generated by **Google Gemini** based on my specific prompts and architecture requirements. I designed the logic and features; the AI wrote the JavaScript and HTML.
