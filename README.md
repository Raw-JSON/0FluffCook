## ✅ V4.0 Major Release: Chef Mode is Live

This release introduces **Chef Mode**, transforming the tool into a dual-purpose culinary assistant. You can now use AI to generate recipes based on simple prompts (like "Orange Chicken") or ingredient lists, all while honoring your persistent, saved dietary rules.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **100% Client-Side:** Zero servers, zero user tracking. All data is saved securely in your browser's local storage.
* **PWA Ready:** Install the app to your desktop or mobile home screen for an instant-loading, offline-capable experience.
* **AI Smart Parse:** Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to intelligently filter noise, format measurements, and structure messy text/URLs into clean JSON.
* **Chef Mode (Generate):** Instantly create new recipes using natural language prompts and constraints.
* **Persistent Rules:** Save custom constraints (e.g., "No spicy food," "must be low-carb") directly in the app settings, which the AI will enforce for all generated recipes.
* **Full Data Control:** Features include Favorites, Manual Editor, and full Backup/Restore functionality (JSON export).
* **OLED Aesthetic:** Built with a sleek, dark-mode focused UI.
